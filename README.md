# 3. Workflow  
1. First Stage:  
&ensp; - Created a hiragana classifier based on Efficientnet  
&ensp; - Created a Web application skeleton  
  
2. Second Stage:   
&ensp; - Deployed the application on EC2 of AWS  
&ensp; - Improved UI and functions  
  
# 4. Challenges  
- **To meet the deadlines because we set a deadline for each stage to simulate the development environment in the industry.**  
&ensp; We have a meeting every day to confirm what we did, what we didn't today, and what we will do tomorrow.  
- **This is the first time to use Flask for both of us**  
&ensp; We implemented a backend side while learning flask, but we made it on time because we are fast learners.  
- **To deploy the application on EC2 of AWS**  
&ensp; Mainly, we struggled with deploying it on EC2, getting a domain, and setting up https:/ with SSL, etc...
